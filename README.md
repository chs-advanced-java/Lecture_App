RecoLecture is an Android application designed for teachers and students.
Teachers can upload recordings of their lectues to their class in the cloud, where the students can "join" the teacher's class to view previously uploaded lectures.

RecoLecture was made by the students of Communications High Shcool in the class of 2017 enrolled in Advanced Programming with Android Studio. This app was made as a submission to the 2016 Congressional App Challenge.
